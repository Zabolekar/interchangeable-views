A simple counter class with multiple interchangeable (and sometimes, although sadly not yet always, combinable) UIs and two interchangeable models.

The most important three classes of this project are called `Model`, `View` and `Controller` and reside in a module called `mvc.py`. However, the project is rather an implementation of the MVP pattern (the kind with a Supervising Controller), not of the MVC pattern.
